Calibration of RNA integrity for accurate transcriptomic wide applications

The project was about estimating the integrity of RNA using direct RNA sequencing reads to provide a robust and transcriptomic-wide integrity assessment measure. Additionally, it pertains to investigating links of the apparent degradation profile with the underlying fragmentation of RNA and envisage tools to improve accuracy and comparative RNA studies in samples with similar and dissimilar degradation levels. 
A new computational tool was developed to characterise RNA degradation from direct RNA sequencing data. HEK293 cell line, on which RNA degradation was performed, tissue sample datasets and myeloma patient sample datasets were analsyed.
